                            p(class="paragraphs__string") Hi, I’m Alvin Cousins, an aspiring web developer, based in London, UK.
                            p(class="paragraphs__string") I have been working towards a new career path in tech since December 2020. This comes after working for over 10 years in the construction industry as an Architectural Lighting Designer/ Consultant and as an Architectural Assistant before that. These years working in construction have given me:
                                ul
                                    li A strong foundation in problem solving and design beyond mere aesthetics.
                                    li Insight into how technologies and systems can elegantly interact and work seamlessly.
                                    li Project delivery and management experience working in various teams with other designers and professionals from other disciplines. 
                            br
                            p(class="paragraphs__string") I have always had a large appetite for learning new things and broadening my skill set whenever the opportunity arose. This attitude along with a humble mindset and willingness to adapt has served me well so far. Hopefully this puts me in good stead to successfully transition into a career in tech.

                                span(class="bold") CS50x – 
                                em Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming, Harvard University. 
                            p(class="paragraphs__string") This course was recommended to me as a way to obtain a solid foundation in the fundamentals before venturing into a career in tech. The course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets are inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. The course culminates in a final project.
