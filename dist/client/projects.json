        "Submission for my CS50x final project: Cook Book, which is an online app which processes and converts recipe quantities with a range of different units. The app was intended to solve the problem of having to deal with a range of different cooking units for recipes over the internet, with the majority of American recipes using imperial units. The app allows a user to simply paste in the ingredients list with quantities, and for each item to be automatically converted to metric units (or vice-versa, to imperial). The app also allows scaling of recipes to accommodate different serving numbers.",
        "The project uses Flask, a back-end Python framework, to handle the processing of data, which is stored in a SQL database (SQLite). Simple JavaScript is also used on the front-end to render changes to serving quantities.",
        "CS50x is a self-paced online introductory Computer Science course created and run by Harvard University. The course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. The course introduces topics on algorithms, data structures, resource management, security and web programming."
